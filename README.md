- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For modern, responsive UI elements such as cards, buttons, icons, tooltips, and layout components.
- **React Redux**: For state management, especially for cart actions and product favorites.
- **React Loading Skeleton**: For displaying loading placeholders while fetching product data.
- **Fetch API**: For retrieving product data from external sources.
